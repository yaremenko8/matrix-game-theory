# Matrix game theory
This repository contains a simple demostration of Haskell's power. Generaly, this is just a bunch of playing around with matrices, however it might be useful to someone who wants to get some idea of what Haskell is and what makes it aesthetically superior to any other HLL. It can also be of great use to those who are having a hard time figuring Haskell out. The mere fact that Haskell does not have indexing as a means of accessing elements of a list might be very confusing to a newcomer. So, hopefuly these code samples will come in handy for someone who wants to know how to go about implementing some basic stuff.<br>
The code samples contain an assortment of matrix operations and their applications in game theory.
